## Example files
Copy the two files into a folder named *tests/* at the same level as the *src/* folder. The test file can be copied (and renamed) as many times as necessary.

At the end, the project should have the following folder structure:
```bash
- project
  - src
  - tests
    - CMakeLists.txt
    - example_1.cpp
    - example_2.cpp
    - ...
  - unit_testing
  - ...
```
